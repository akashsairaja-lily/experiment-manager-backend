# Product Type Review API - Backend Implementation

This repository implements a backend API for the **Product Type Review / Control Flow** feature, which supports reviewing, filtering, and approving products in the context of experiments.

---

## 1. **API Overview**

The backend provides endpoints for:
- Getting and filtering experiments
- Retrieving and filtering products with pagination
- Approving products
- Getting product type distributions
- Marking experiments as complete

### API Structure
See the OpenAPI specification in `demo/swagger.yaml` for detailed API documentation.

## 2. **Backend Implementation Requirements**

### Core Requirements
- You must implement a mock API server that follows the OpenAPI specification.
- Your implementation must support all the functionality needed by the frontend:
    - Experiment listing and filtering
    - Product filtering, pagination, and sorting
    - Product approval
    - Product type statistics
    - Experiment completion

### Data Models
The API works with the following core data models:
- **Experiment**: Contains experiment metadata and status
- **Product**: Represents product data with approval status
- **ProductType**: Contains product type statistics and distributions

---

## 3. **Backend Mocking Requirements**

- You must **hardcode the API responses**.
- Use **Node.js** and **Express** for the mock server implementation.
- Your mock endpoints must replicate the full functionality and data structure expected by the frontend (products, experiments, filters, approval actions, etc.).
- No real database integration is requiredâ€”just return hardcoded/mock data for all endpoints.
- If you use **NestJS** (a progressive Node.js framework), this will be considered a **bonus point** as it demonstrates knowledge of scalable backend architecture and TypeScript-first server development.

---

## 4. **Mocking Guidance**
To fully mock the backend for this flow:
- All experiment, product, and filter data must be mocked.
- Endpoints for product fetching, approving, and status updates must return realistic payloads.
- Support search, filtering, pagination, and status change flows in the mock server.
- Ensure responses are consistent with the OpenAPI specification.

---

## 5. **Technical Stack**

### Core Stack

- **TypeScript**: All code should be written in TypeScript.
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for the backend.
- **Express**: Web framework for creating API endpoints.

### Additional/Bonus Tools

- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications (bonus).
- **Lodash**: Utility library for common JS data operations.
- **Jest**: For unit and integration testing of API endpoints.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: For API documentation.
- **Prettier & ESLint**: For code linting and formatting.

## 6. **Pull Request and Branching Standards**

**It is mandatory to follow these PR and branch management standards for this task:**

- **Do NOT merge any code directly into the `main` branch.**
- Always work on feature branches.
- Use the following branching model:
    - Create a main parent feature branch:
      e.g., `feature/backend-mock` or `feature/api-endpoints`
    - For each new story, bugfix, or sub-feature, create a story branch on top of the parent feature branch:
      e.g., `story/experiments-api`, `story/products-api`
    - Raise PRs *from story branch to the parent feature branch*, never to `main`.
    - Merge each story/feature one at a time to the parent feature branch.
    - Use clear and descriptive PR names, referencing the feature or issue you are working on.

**Example flow:**
1. Create `feature/backend-mock`.
2. Create `story/products-api` from `feature/backend-mock`.
3. Implement the products API mock, then raise a PR from `story/products-api` to `feature/backend-mock`.
4. Repeat for other features or stories.
5. Only after all review cycles and QA merge the `feature/backend-mock` branch into `main` (if authorized).
